    Zoof - Let's code

----

The purpose of Zoof is to lower the barriers for scientific computing
by providing an IDE that is simple and intuitive, yet promotes a
powerful and highly interactive workflow to use dynamic languages.

Zoof will initially target Python and Julia, but will extend to other
languages over time.

      Zoof is aimed to make coding easier.

    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Get going quickly</h4>
      Zoof can use programming languages that are already installed, or
      you can easily spawn a new environment.

    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <h4><i class="fa fa-child"></i> Open source</h4>
      Zoof is free as in speech. Found a bug? Want a new feature? You can 
      contribute to the improvement of Zoof, or write an extension.
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <h4><i class="fa fa-beer"></i> Always free</h4>
      Zoof is free and always will be. To make Zoof sustainable, we sell the 
      Zoof gold edition. The extra features in Gold are of cosmetic nature;
      the free version has no restrictions in functionality.

    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <h4><i class="fa fa-flag"></i> Multiple languages</h4>
      Zoof has support for multiple languages. Is your language not listed?
      Maybe you can help!

The goal of Zoof is to lower the barriers of (scientific) programming.

To get started, download Zoof and start it up, set up an environment
with the language of your choice, and start coding. An intuitive
interface will guide novel users through the process, and will provide
tutorial materials if necessary. At the same time, the interface does
not get in the way and is powerful enough to support the workflow of
advanced programmers.

Zoof supports multiple progamming languages, focusing on dynamic
languages (that support the interactve work flow of Zoof). At first we
will focus on Python and Julia, and other languages can be added via
an extension mechanism.


Zoof can be seen as the successor of IEP and Pyzo, and it actually
combines the two projects into a single application. We started with a
clean sheet and build Zoof up while trying to reuse as much code from
the former projects as we can. You can see the progress at
http://github.com/zoofIO/zoof. Of course we have style and unit tests
covered by continuous intgration.
