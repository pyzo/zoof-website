This repo holds the source code for the (now deprecated) Zoof.io website. 
Ideas to move Pyzo further (when Pyzo was called IEP and Pyzo was a distro) were collected
under the name "Zoof" and put in the open at zoof.io. A lot has happened since then. Some
ideas have been put into practice in Pyzo. More may be done in Pyzo 5. The name "zoof"
is now reserved for something else.
